Hi, I’m Pieter-Jan – a quantitative researcher who’s passionate about markets, data, and building systematic trading strategies. I’ve spent the last few years nerding out on machine learning for long/short equity, trend following, and portfolio optimization. 

On this blog I'll share insights, experiments, and lessons learned—mostly about machine learning, trading strategies, and the process of building systematic approaches to markets. Whether you’re into data science, finance, or just curious about algorithmic trading, I hope you find something here worth reading!
