Hi, I’m Pieter-Jan. I’m a quant researcher who enjoys exploring markets, data, and systematic strategies. Over the years, I’ve worked on machine learning for long/short equity, trend following, and portfolio optimization—but honestly, I’m just figuring things out as I go.  

This blog is where I share insights, experiments, and whatever I find interesting. Most of it will probably be about trading, data, and machine learning, but who knows—life takes unexpected turns. If you’re into any of that, I hope you find something here worth reading.
