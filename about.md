Hi, I’m Pieter-Jan – a quant researcher who’s passionate about markets, data and building systematic trading strategies. I’ve spent the last few years working on machine learning for long/short equity, trend following, and portfolio optimization. 

By day, I’m coding up algorithms and backtesting strategies. Outside of work, I like staying active, exploring new places, and keeping up with the latest in tech and finance.  

On this blog I'll share insights, experiments, and lessons learned—mostly about machine learning, trading strategies, and the process of building systematic approaches to markets. Whether you’re into data science, finance, or just curious about algorithmic trading, I hope you find something here worth reading!
